# The job of Rapido cut scripts is to generate a VM image. This is done using
# Dracut with the following parameters...

# --install provides a list of binaries that should be included in the VM image.
# Dracut will resolve shared object dependencies and add them automatically.

# --include copies a specific file or directory to the given image destination.
# The .profile image path is special, in that it is executed on boot.

# --add-drivers provides a list of kernel modules, which will be obtained from
# the rapido.conf KERNEL_INSTALL_MOD_PATH

# --modules provides a list of *Dracut* modules. See Dracut documentation for
# details

# DRACUT_EXTRA_ARGS in rapido.conf allows for extra custom Dracut parameters for
# debugging, etc.
